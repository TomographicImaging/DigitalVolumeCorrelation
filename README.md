# Digital Volume Correlation
The Digital Volume Correlation is based on Brian Bay's code from:
* Bay, B.K., Smith, T.S., Fyhrie, D.P., Saad, M., 1999. Digital volume correlation: Three-dimensional strain mapping using x-ray tomography. Experimental Mechanics 39, 217â€“226.

## Build

The package comes as a [CMake](https://cmake.org) project so you will need CMake (v.>=3) to configure it. Additionally you will need a C compiler, `make` (on linux). The toolkit comes with an executable `dvc` which may be used directly. We provide wrappers for Python.

1. Clone this repository to a directory, i.e. `CCPi-DVC`,
2. create a build directory.
3. Issue `cmake` to configure (or `cmake-gui`, or `ccmake`, or `cmake3`). Use additional flags to fine tune the configuration.

### CMake flags
Flags used during configuration

| CMake flag | type | meaning |
|:---|:----|:----|
| `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` | string | Defaults to `C++11`.
| `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` | path | your favourite install directory |
|`BUILD_TEST` | bool | `ON\|OFF` whether to build the test mode|

Here an example of build on Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TomographicImaging/DigitalVolumeCorrelation
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../CCPi-DVC -DCONDA_BUILD=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<your favourite install directory>
make install
```

## Open MP

### Setting the Number of Threads Using an OpenMP Environment Variable
You can set the number of threads using the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`. If this is higher than the number of processors it will instead use the number of processors available.
