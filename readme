Initial code transfer of diamond_dvc software to CCPi

1. Executable (dvc) and object files (/include/objects) removed

2. make from command line in main directory will build (gnu c++)

3. The only external is a simple fully embedded linear algebra package (eigen)

4. Once compiled, just type dvc on a command line to see if the code responds

Testing

1. The "Volcano test data" makes a good code test case

2. Files are in the folder /dvc_test

	*** the actual raw image volumes have been removed
	*** put frame_000.raw and frame_010.raw back into the two _crop folders
	
3. Move into the dvc_test folder and run from there:

	../dvc dvc_input.txt

	- the point cloud for analysis is in the file central_grid.roi
	- if paths are good and files are found, a sorting process is started
	- then tracking starts, with results echoed to the terminal window
	- during the run (may take a while) a status file is updated (.stat)
	- after completion the diaplcement results are stored (.disp)
	- example completed run files are included (central_grid_results)
	- post-processed results also indluded (DVC_initial_test_pptx_zip)
	
4. We do most post-processing in Matlab

	- drop the .disp file into the workspace as column vectors
	- the columns_to_matrix_reg_grid.m script organizes data into matrices
	- the simple_strain_calc.m script does a very basic strain calculation
	- quiver3 plots are useful for visualizing the displacement vectors
	- surf plots of displacement and strain components show deformations
